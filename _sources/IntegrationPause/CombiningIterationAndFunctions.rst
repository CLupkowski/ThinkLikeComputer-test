Combining Iterations and Functions
==================================

In this section, we will look at examples where:
* Inside an iterating for loop, we invoke a function
* Inside a function, we use iteration


Code Re-Use
-----------

Both functions and iteration are ways to avoid typing the same (or very similar) lines of code over and over again. This is important because if you have similar lines of code and you discover a bug in one of them, or decide to make a change, you have to make that change in all of them. Whenever you are writing code, if you find yourself writing the same (or very similar) lines of code over and over again, you can probably simplify your code, either by putting that code into a function, or by putting that code inside a loop.
