Building a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
=========================================

One of the important parts of event-based programming is building an interface for the user to interact with (after all, there is no point in creating event-handlers, if there is no way for a user to do anything). Now an event-based program can use a number of different modalities: it could be a graphical user interface (like most of the software on your computer, or a voice-interface (like a Google Home or Amazon Alexa), or a gestural-interface (like the Microsoft Kinect), etc. We are going to focus on Graphical User Interfaces as they are still the most common interfaces. And so, you need to learn a bit about how graphical user interfaces are built.  

Imagine Building From Scratch!
------------------------------

Both functions and iteration are ways to avoid typing the same (or very similar) lines of code over and over again. This is important because if you have similar lines of code and you discover a bug in one of them, or decide to make a change, you have to make that change in all of them. Whenever you are writing code, if you find yourself writing the same (or very similar) lines of code over and over again, you can probably simplify your code, either by putting that code into a function, or by putting that code inside a loop.
