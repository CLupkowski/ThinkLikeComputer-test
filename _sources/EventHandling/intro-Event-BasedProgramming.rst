Event-Based Programming
=======================

Throughout this book, we have seen tidbits of event-based programming, but here we formally introduce the idea, and help you to understand the structure of event-based programming, which underlies many of the software systems, mobile apps, video games, and other digital systems you use daily. This is a huge topic, and there are entire books and courses about how to do event-based programming and how to design user interfaces for such programs. This chapter gives you a high level overview and a chance to briefly try out these concepts. 


Topics
------

* Understand what event-based programming is, and how it differs from other types of programs
* Understand that a GUI designed by the programmer is the visual representation that a user interacts with
* Understand that a programmer writes event handlers that are functions that get executed when a user interacts with the interface
* Understand that after a GUI is built and the event handlers are written, the event handlers have to be connected to the GUI objects
